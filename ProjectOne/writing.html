  Vertical bus stop ads on George Street in New Brunswick
  <ul>
  <li>On George Street in New Brunswick. Sidewalks are small so people usually have to walk around the bus stop. Bus stop ads are clearly in view when walking down sidewalk. Doesn't make any noise so text is especially important. Vertical format could present some issues, text may need to be reimagined. Can be walked around and interacted with. Mabe have a monster that looks like its sitting on the bus stop bench?

  Horizontal billboards on the side/top of buildings in a public city
  <ul>
  <li>
  Digital advertising boards on the sides of buildings around Penn Station in New York. Very visible space. Very large scale. Seen from afar and cannot be interacted with. Can be seen by pedestrians and cars. Looks Signs are free standing over sidewalk so may look like it actually happening in the space rather than on a screen
